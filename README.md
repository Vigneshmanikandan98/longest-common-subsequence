# longest-common-subsequence

we have calculated the length of the Longest Common Subsequence of two strings by implementing Brute Force, Dynamic Programming and Dynamic programming with two arrays methods. As the result, we have displayed the length of LCS and the time taken for the algorithm to calculate it but, for Dynamic programming with two arrays method we have displayed the two arrays side by side as per the requirements.

This is one of the assignment given by the professor.
